# Strengths & Storytelling Reflection 

* Write 1-2 paragraphs about your StrengthsFinder themes: How have you seen yourself using these strengths at Turing? Has your understanding of these strengths changed since you first reflected on them? If so, how?


I have seen learner, in that I am determined to figure out what every thing means to me no matter how long it takes.
I have always prided myself on how quickly I pick things up. JavaScript has not come so easy to me. I have worked on self acceptance with this type of subject matter, and other factors such as concentration and tools for coping in a busy and loud school.
I have also seen alot of my Futuristic and Ideation come out but I haven't become comfortable enought with JavaScipt to feel as though i can spend alot of time day dreaming. I hope to continue to pick up on writing myr prototypes and functions and learning methods so that I can create beautiful code that I can be proud of. Thay will be inspiring and allow me to daydream, again!

* Write a story about your Turing experience so far: When have you struggled? How have you dealt with struggle? When have you succeeded at Turing? How did you accomplish those successes?

Turing has already been a journey with alot of struggle. First it was about getting enough sleep and learning how to timeblock
and timeblock my timeblocks. Its been alot of ego crushing and self acceptance and learning who i am within this new career path. Now, its trying to play catch up with everything we have learned before next week. The struggle seems it will always be theres, its now about managing time and stress so the struggle can be met with my best foot forward. I have been very proud of my sucess with my progress from the first codepen website we built to my static-comp-3, I am now building with grid. I am also proud of  staying here instead of running off and sticking with my old habits. Learning to trust the process, im still working on but seeing results and finding that the journey is unfolding, and I am still driving.


* After you practice storytelling in the session, answer this question: What was particularly easy or difficult about telling your story? What are 1-2 steps that you can take to continue to improve your abilities to tell your story, talk about yourself with ease, and examine your strengths?
Its easy to tell my story because my struggles really stand out to me in this process of becoming. I would like to make more examples and find a more poetic way of explaining what i've experienced so that the reader can visualize what I am.
