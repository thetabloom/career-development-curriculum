Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?): see above.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):
We will use this pairing to support our learning and getting down the flow of git and coding.

Open and empathetic and asking if am crossing boundaries when i’m direct. I expect the same.
